# Project 1 - An Analyss on the Canadian Cannabis Industry 
## __Overview__
5 topics for this Canadian Cannabs Industry EDA project were identified and involved analyzng market trends, product trends, and changes in cannabis use amongst different demographics during different time periods. 

## __Topics Covered__
- Topic 1: Cannabis Recreational Store Growth Analysis in Canada
- Topic 2: Retail vs Medical Stores Growth
- Topic 3: Cannabis Market Share by Product Type
- Topic 4: Yearly Cannabis Use Change by Gender: 2017 to 2022
- Topic 5: Topic 5: Cannabis Use Change during First Wave of the Covid Pandemic Analyzed by Age Group, Ethnicity, and Income Level (May 2020 to March 2021)

## __Data__
- The Topic 4 dataset consists of a merged database of several Canadian Cannabis Survey responses from 2017 to 2022. Due to the significant amount of information in these reports, Table 1 from each report was extracted and merged into a single data table for the analysis of cannabis use by gender. 
- The Topic 5 dataset consists of the approximately 6000+ survey responses collected in the “Alcohol and cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic” survey by BMC Public Health. The dataset has been filtered for only the cannabis-use related columns. Please note that this dataset contains qualitative responses regarding changes in cannabis use, which is subjective and may not accurately portrait just how cannabis use has increased or decreased during the pandemic.

## __Code Contents__
- *Data Import and Cleaning*
    - File paths are defined and the datasets are improted and cleaning for the analysis. This entails addressing missing values, converting data types, and filtering for only the columns necessary for the analysis.
- *Data Visualizations* 
    - Line, bar, pie, and donut charts were generated to visualize various trends regarding inventory, revenue, product sales, and changes in cannabis use. 
- *Analysis and Conclusions*
    - Observations of any trends in the visuals were recorded and analyzed to understand the state of the current cannabis market and to forecast how these trends will change in the future.
