# Project_1 - An Analyss on the Canadian Cannabis Industry 
Topic 4: How Cannabis Use has Changed across gender over the years, and Topic 5: How Cannabis Use Changes Varied Across Different Demographics 

__Overview__
These 2 topics for this Canadian Cannabs Industry EDA project involves analyzng changes in cannabis use amongst different demographics during different time periods. The first analysis is on gender and cannabis use over the years, and the second analysis looks at how cannabis use has changed during the Covid Pandemic Wave 1 amongst 3 demographics: age group, ethnicity, and income level.

__Data__
- The Topic 4 dataset consists of a merged database of several Canadian Cannabis Survey responses from 2017 to 2022. Due to the significant amount of information in these reports, Table 1 from each report was extracted and merged into a single data table for the analysis of cannabis use by gender. 
- The Topic 5 dataset consists of the approximately 6000+ survey responses collected in the “Alcohol and cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic” survey by BMC Public Health. The dataset has been filtered for only the cannabis-use related columns. Please note that this dataset contains qualitative responses regarding changes in cannabis use, which is subjective and may not accurately portrait just how cannabis use has increased or decreased during the pandemic.
